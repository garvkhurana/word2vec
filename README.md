# word2vec
Creating and Practicing Your Own Word2Vec Model
Overview
In this project, you will learn how to create and practice your own Word2Vec model using a dataset. Word2Vec is a popular technique in natural language processing (NLP) for learning word embeddings, which are dense vector representations of words in a continuous vector space.

This README provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up your environment, preprocess your dataset, train your Word2Vec model, and practice with it using various NLP tasks.

Requirements
To follow along with this project, you will need:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)
Required Python libraries: gensim, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, NLTK, RE
Dataset
You can use any text corpus or dataset of your choice. Some common sources include:

Wikipedia articles
News articles
Books
Twitter

Steps
Setup Environment: Install Python and the required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file. You can install them using pip:
bash
Preprocess Dataset: Clean and preprocess your dataset to remove noise, punctuation, and stopwords. Tokenize the text into words or phrases.
Train Word2Vec Model: Train your Word2Vec model using the preprocessed dataset. You can adjust hyperparameters such as vector dimensionality, window size, and training algorithm.
Evaluate Model: Evaluate the trained Word2Vec model using intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods. Intrinsic evaluation involves tasks like word similarity and analogy tests. Extrinsic evaluation involves using the word embeddings in downstream NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or named entity recognition.
Practice with Word Embeddings: Once you have a trained Word2Vec model, you can use it for various NLP tasks such as:
Finding similar words
Performing word arithmetic (e.g., king - man + woman = queen)
Clustering words into semantic groups
Visualizing word embeddings using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE
Usage
Follow the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts provided in this repository to execute each step of the project. You can adapt the code to your specific dataset and requirements.
